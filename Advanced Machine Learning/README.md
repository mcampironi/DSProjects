## Introduction
Correctly rotating an image is a simple task for a human being, but it turns out to be a real challenge for a computer. Most applications in the world of computer vision require images to be properly oriented before they can be processed. However rotating images is a
tedious, time-consuming and error-prone activity. The goal is therefore to exploit convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically orient the images by multiple angles of 90Â°.

## Methodological Approach
