       "  'abstract': 'We consider a Cournot oligopoly game, where firms produce an homogenous good and the demand and cost functions are nonlinear. These features make the classical best reply solution difficult to be obtained, even if players have full information about their environment. We propose two different kinds of repeated games based on a lower degree of rationality of the firms, on a reduced information set and reduced computational capabilities. The first adjustment mechanism is called \"Local Monopolistic Approximation\" (LMA). First firms get the correct local estimate of the demand function and then they use such estimate in a linear approximation of the demand function where the effects of the competitors\\' outputs are ignored. On the basis of this subjective demand function they solve their profit maximization problem. By using the second adjustment process, that belongs to a class of adaptive mechanisms known in the literature as \"Gradient Dynamics\" (GD), firms do not solve any optimization problem, but they adjust their production in the direction indicated by their (correct) estimate of the marginal profit. Both these repeated games may converge to a Cournot-Nash equilibrium, i.e. to the equilibrium of the best reply dynamics. We compare the properties of the two different dynamical systems that describe the time evolution of the oligopoly games under the two adjustment mechanisms, and we analyze the conditions that lead to non-convergence and complex dynamic behaviors. The paper extends the results of other authors that consider similar adjustment processes assuming Linear cost functions or linear demand functions.',\n",

Multi-centre studies are particularly helpful in cancer research as they allow researchers to evaluate the efficacy of a therapy in a variety of patients and settings, making it possible to investigate the effect of treatments in those cases when it is difficult, or even impossible, for a single centre to recruit the required number of patients. It is often argued, however, that despite agreement among different centres to follow common standardized protocols, variation may occur in both baseline characteristics of the recruited patients and in treatment effects. This heterogeneity should be detected and, if present, accounted for in the data analysis. Furthermore, the longitudinal nature of these types of experimental studies raises the problem of attrition, that is, patients may dropout of the study for a number of reasons mainly death or disease progression. In this paper, we consider the health related quality of life of advanced melanoma patients in a longitudinal multi-centre randomized clinical trial comparing two different anti-tumoural treatments. We propose a Heckman type model to account for the possibility that patients dropout according to a non-ignorable mechanism. The model is extended to a multilevel setting to account both for the longitudinal nature and the multi-centre structure of the design. We found a strong variation across centres in the quality of life evaluation. The effect of centres on the dropout was not found to be relevant in the considered data although dropout does depend on patient's characteristics.\",\n",

This paper fills this gap by providing a detailed comparison of the three most popular models designed to describe asymmetric price behavior, namely asymmetric ECM, autoregressive threshold ECM and ECM with threshold cointegration. Each model is estimated on a common monthly data set for the gasoline markets of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK over the period 1985-2003. All models are able to capture the temporal delay in the reaction of retail prices to changes in spot gasoline and crude oil prices, as well as some evidence of asymmetric behavior. However, the type of market and the number of countries which are characterized by asymmetric oil-gasoline price relations vary across models. The asymmetric ECM prescribes that long-run price asymmetries are most likely to be found in the second stage of the transmission chain. Conversely, the ECM with threshold cointegration suggests that long-run price asymmetries vary across countries and markets. Short-run price asymmetries are captured by the asymmetric ECM specification and the TAR-ECM. The latter model suggests that all European countries are likely to be affected by asymmetries at the distribution stage, while the results obtained with the asymmetric ECM are mixed.',\n",

Most contributions in this area have agreed on the neoclassical principle of a representative optimizing firm and typically use theory-based structural equation models (SEM). A popular alternative to SEM is the vector autoregression (VAR) methodology. The most recent attempts to link the SEM approach with VAR analysis in the area of factor demands concentrate on single-equation models, whereas no effort has been devoted to compare these alternative approaches when a firm is assumed to face a multi-factor technology and to decide simultaneously the optimal quantity for each input. This paper bridges this gap. First, we illustrate how the SEM and the VAR approaches can both represent valid alternatives to model systems of dynamic factor demands. Second, we show how to apply both methodologies to estimate dynamic factor demands derived from a cost-minimizing capital-labour-energy-materials (KLEM) technology with adjustment costs (ADC) on the quasi-fixed capital factor. Third, we explain how to use both models to calculate some widely accepted indicators of the production structure of an economic sector, such as price and quantity elasticities, and alternative measures of ADC. In particular, we propose and discuss some theoretical and empirical justifications of the differences between observed elasticities, measures of ADC, and the assumption of exogeneity of output and/or input prices.

Relative to the previous literature, this paper is novel in several respects. First, it presents a detailed and updated survey of the existing empirical contributions on price asymmetries in the transmission mechanism linking input prices to output prices. Second, this paper presents an extension of the traditional distinction between long-run and short-run asymmetries to new categories of asymmetries, such as: contemporaneous impact, distributed lag effect, cumulated impact, reaction time, equilibrium and momentum equilibrium adjustment path, regime effect, regime equilibrium adjustment path. Each empirical study is then critically discussed in the light of this new classification of asymmetries. Third, this paper evaluates the relative merits of the most popular econometric models for price asymmetries, namely autoregressive distributed lags, partial adjustments, error correction models, regime switching and vector autoregressive models. Finally, we use the meta-regression analysis to investigate whether the results of asymmetry tests are not model-invariant and find which additional factors systematically influence the rejection of the null hypothesis of symmetric price adjustment. The main results of our survey can be summarized as follows: (i) each econometric model is specialized to capture a subset of asymmetries; (ii) each asymmetry is better investigated by a subset of econometric models; (iii) the general significance of the F test for asymmetric price transmission depends mainly on characteristics of the data, dynamic specification of the econometric model, and market characteristics. Overall, our empirical findings confirm that asymmetry, in all its forms, is very likely to occur in a wide range of markets and econometric models.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Oil shocks are generally acknowledged to have important effects on both economic activity and macroeconomic policy. The aim of this paper is to investigate how oil price shocks affect the growth rate of output of a subset of developed countries by comparing alternative regime switching models. Different Markov-Switching (MS) regime autoregressive models are, therefore, specified and estimated. In a successive step, univariate MS models are extended in order to verify if the inclusion of asymmetric oil shocks as an exogenous variable improves the ability of each specification to identify the different phases of the business cycle for each country under scrutiny. Following the wide literature on this topic, seven different definitions of oil shocks which are able to describe oil price changes, asymmetric transformations of oil price changes, oil price volatility, and oil supply conditions are considered. Our findings can be summarized as follows. While the introduction of different oil shock specifications is never rejected, positive oil price changes, net oil price increases and oil price volatility are the oil shock definitions which contribute to a better description of the impact of oil on output growth. In addition, models with exogenous oil variables generally outperform the corresponding univariate specifications which exclude oil from the analysis. However, a stability analysis of the coefficients across different subsamples shows that the role of oil shocks in explaining recessionary episodes has changed over time. Improvements in energy efficiency, together with a better systematic approach to external supply and demand shocks by monetary and fiscal authorities are argued to be responsible for the changing macroeconomic effects of oil shocks. Finally, the impact of G-7 countries aggregate growth on oil market conditions is considered and assessed empirically. The null hypothesis of the absence of a reverse relationship from real GDP growth to oil prices is rejected by the data.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Recent literature has pointed out that information asymmetries may be the reason for the poor performance of structural credit risk models to fit corporate bond data. It is well known in fact that these models lead to a strong undestatement of the credit spread terms structure, particularly on the short maturity end. Possible explanations stem from strategic debt service behavior and, as discovered more recently, the problem of accounting transparency. This raises the possibility that some of these flaws could be reconducted to a sort of 'Peso problem', i.e. that the market may ask for a premium in order to allow for a small probability that accounting data may actually be biased (Baglioni and Cherubini, 2005). In this paper we propose a modified version of the Duan (1994,2000) MLE approach to structural models estimation in order to allow for this 'Peso problem' effect. The model is estimated for the Parmalat case, one of the most famous cases of accounting opacity, using both equity and CDS data.\",\n",

(2002), and the Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) model of Engle (2002). The dynamic correlations are extremely useful in determining whether the spot and forward returns are substitutes or complements, which can be used to hedge against contingencies. Both the univariate ARCH and GARCH estimates are significant for spot and forward returns, whereas the estimates of the asymmetric effect at the univariate level are not statistically significant for either spot or forward returns. Standard diagnostic tests show that the AR(1)-GARCH(1, 1) and AR(1)-GJR(1, 1) specifications are statistically adequate for both the conditional mean and the conditional variance. The multivariate estimates for the VAR(1)-GARCH(1, 1) and VAR(1)-AGARCH(1, 1) models show that the ARCH and GARCH effects for spot (forward) returns are significant in the conditional volatility model for spot (forward) returns. Moreover, there are significant interdependences in the conditional volatilities between the spot and forward markets. The multivariate asymmetric effects are significant for both spot and forward returns. Overall the multivariate VAR(1)-AGARCH(1, 1) dominates its symmetric counterpart. The calculated constant conditional correlations between the conditional volatilities of spot and forward returns using CCC-GARCH(1, 1), VAR(1)-GARCH(1, 1) and VAR(1)-AGARCH(1, 1) are very close to 0.93. Virtually identical results are obtained when the three constant conditional correlation models are extended to include two lags in both the ARCH and GARCH components. Finally, the estimates of the two DCC parameters are statistically significant, which makes it clear that the assumption of constant conditional correlation is not supported empirically. This is highlighted by the dynamic conditional correlations between spot and forward returns, for which its sample mean is virtually identical to the computed constant conditional correlation, regardless of whether a DCC-GARCH(1, 1) or a DCC-GARCH(2, 2) is used. For these models, the dynamic conditional correlations are in the range (0.417, 0.993) and (0.446, 0.993), signifying medium to extreme interdependence. Therefore, the dynamic volatilities in the returns in Tapis oil spot and forward markets are generally interdependent over time. These findings suggest that a sensible hedging strategy would consider spot and forward markets as being characterized by different degrees of substitutability.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: The primary objective of this study was to make the first step in the modelling of pharmaceutical demand in Italy, by deriving a weighted capitation model to account for demographic differences among general practices. The experimental model was called ASSET (Age/Sex Standardised Estimates of Treatment). METHODS AND MAJOR FINDINGS: Individual prescription costs and demographic data referred to 3,175,691 Italian subjects and were collected directly from three Regional Health Authorities over the 12-month period between October 2004 and September 2005. The mean annual prescription cost per individual was similar for males (196.13 euro) and females (195.12 euro). After 65 years of age, the mean prescribing costs for males were significantly higher than females. On average, costs for a 75-year-old subject would be 12 times the costs for a 25-34 year-old subject if male, 8 times if female. Subjects over 65 years of age (22% of total population) accounted for 56% of total prescribing costs. The weightings explained approximately 90% of the evolution of total prescribing costs, in spite of the pricing and reimbursement turbulences affecting Italy in the 2000-2005 period. The ASSET weightings were able to explain only about 25% of the variation in prescribing costs among individuals. CONCLUSIONS: If mainly idiosyncratic prescribing by general practitioners causes the unexplained variations, the introduction of capitation-based budgets would gradually move practices with high prescribing costs towards the national average. It is also possible, though, that the unexplained individual variation in prescribing costs is the result of differences in the clinical characteristics or socio-economic conditions of practice populations. If this is the case, capitation-based budgets may lead to unfair distribution of resources. The ASSET age/sex weightings should be used as a guide, not as the ultimate determinant, for an equitable allocation of prescribing resources to regional authorities and general practices.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this paper we investigate the issues involved in cross-ownership between banks and firms. The idea is that congruity among the parties in control of the bank and the firm allows savings in monitoring costs, but gives rise to a conflict of interest with outside investors of the bank, such as depositors. In a world of asymmetric information between investors and entrepreneurs, monitoring can be valuable for creditors, by improving entrepreneurial incentives to choose good projects whenever external finance is needed. However, monitoring is costly. Closer relationships between banks and firms as, for instance, in the case of cross-ownership between banks and firms, reduce monitoring costs. The increased congruence between the parties in control of the bank and of the firm reduces the need of information for the banker about the projects that seek finance. However, it might give rise to a conflict of interest, particularly in the choice of the project to be financed by the bank, for which depositors pay the cost through an increasing risk of bankruptcy. In other words, when the banker, by acting as an entrepreneur, chooses to finance a bad project on his own project, he might increase the risk of bankruptcy for the bank, reducing the value of the claims in the hands of depositors. Nevertheless, we show in this paper that there are benefits from cross-ownership, under the condition that the bank involved in the relationship is debt financed and well diversified. The conflict of interest is, in fact, less of a problem when the bank is debt financed and diversified. The reason is that, as diversification increases, debt claims converge to a fixed promise to depositors. Thus, the banker becomes the residual claimant of all the gains from choosing the good project and can credibly commit to make the right choice when financing his own business',\n",

Our aim was to develop an accurate analysis method of prescribing patterns in general practice and to be able to explain individual variations in prescribing costs based on the age/sex distribution of the population and individual clinical needs. Methods: Individual cost data were collected for 3,175,691 subjects living in three different Italian regions (Lombardy, situated in the North, Marche in the Centre and Basilicata in the South). The observation period was 12 months (September 2004 ¿ August 2005). Results: The analysis by ATC classes showed large variations in prescribing costs for the different age groups in each of the ATC classes for both sexes, and, in some instances, wide differences in prescribing costs by gender. The largest cost difference between age groups, for both males and females, was seen in drugs for the cardiovascular system. Antibiotics revealed a difference from the general pattern with more prescriptions in the youngest age groups compared to other ATC classes. Large differences between sexes were observed in the older age groups in drugs used for the respiratory system. The ASSET sample was a robust proxy of the actual public spending by ATC, while the therapeutic group age/sex related weightings were unable to explain the large individual variations in individual prescribing costs.Conclusion: The outcomes of this study are apparently discordant with the conclusions of the limited published literature on prescribing analysis in general practice, suggesting that the ability to make more accurate comparisons of prescribing rates, especially in individual therapeutic groups, should help to provide a more sensitive measure when estimating prescribing costs. The ASSET model confirmed the validity of demographic adjusted models to quantify the impact of ageing population in terms of resources needed to satisfy long term population prescribing needs. The ASSET age/sex weightings of total prescribing costs should be used as a guide, not as the ultimate determinant, for an equitable allocation of prescribing resources in conjunction with historic utilisation and cost data.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The level at which collective bargaining takes place is usually considered important in determining wage levels and wage inequalities. Two different situations are considered: a first in which bargaining is only ‘multi-employer’, and a second in which it is ‘multi-level’, in the sense that workers can be covered by both a ‘multi-employer’ and a ‘single-employer’ contract at the same time. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the impact of these different institutional settings on pay dispersion. The study is carried out using the European Structure of Earnings Survey, which is a large dataset containing detailed matched employer–employee information for the year 1995. The countries analysed are Italy,Belgium and Spain. The empirical results generally show that wages of workers covered by only a ‘multi-employer’ contract are no more compressed than those of workers covered by both ‘multi-employer’ and ‘single-employer’ contracts. This implies that where workers are not covered by single-employer bargaining, they receive wage supplements paid unilaterally by their employers.',\n",

To test the existence of heterogeneity in the impact of flexibility on job satisfaction, the paper verifies whether this relation varies with workers’ characteristics. Empirical evidence is based on a representative sample of European employees taken from a specific wave of the Eurobarometer survey. An ordered probit estimator is used to get the relevant estimates and endogeneity problems have been addressed by exploiting the richness of the data-set in terms of information on workers’ attitude toward work and life (used as proxies of unobserved time-invariant factors, which are the primary source of endogeneity). A positive link was found between functional flexibility and job satisfaction and either no effect or a negative impact of quantitative flexibility. The positive impact of functional flexibility is greater when considering satisfaction for intrinsic aspects of the job. Estimates by workers’ characteristics highlight interesting differences by age, skill and country of residence.',\n",

We use a cross-sectional household survey from rural Bangladesh to test whether migration is a diversification strategy that enables sending households to uptake high-yielding seed technology. We account for heterogeneity of migration constraints by differentiating between temporary-domestic, permanent-domestic and international movement. We find that households able to engage in costly high-return migration (i.e. international migration) are more likely to employ modern farming technology, thereby achieving higher productivity. Poorer households, on the other hand, are unable to overcome the entry costs of cross-border movement and fall back on low net-return (i.e. domestic) migration, which does not drive production enhancements and may act as a poverty-trap.',\n",

It first considers the question of demand, both public and private, and then it deals with various aspects of supply, including the big contractors, the most important foremen, and the motley work force they employed. The final part deals with the way salaries were made up, which provides an important key to understanding how the labour market in the building trades functioned in 18th century Milan. The first features that emerge from this inquiry into the Milanese building trades in the 18th century enable us to understand that opportunities already existed or were created for the introduction of organisational solutions linked to the market even within these pre-industrial economic and social relationships-solutions that were highly efficient in comparison to the technological and productive organisation. It would seem that, in the more advanced urban economic systems of the early modern era (like Milan's), market mechanisms had penetrated deeply and market circulation, both in goods and people, had already reached a high level.\",\n",

After the potential endogeneity of job type has been controlled for, the results show that what matters for job satisfaction is not just the type of contract, but mainly the perceived job security, which may be independent of the type of contract. The combination “temporary but secure job” seems preferable to the combination “permanent but insecure job”, indicating that the length of the contract may be less important if the worker perceives that s/he is not at risk of becoming unemployed.

The Italian research group decided to support specific research on situations in individual towns by setting up a database, which has made it possible to substantiate many of the claims that were emerging about the function and history of guilds. The article, starting from database informations, contributes to international debate on guilds and provides new insights on Italian case with special regards to the relationship between guilds and economic trend, guilds and technical progress, guilds and apprenticeship. In particular it emphasized that the dynamic role played by guilds did not diminish, but rather was redefined to highlight both their mercantile function as new markets began to develop and their ability to coordinate decentralized production in a pre-industrial environment. It seems necessary to clear urban guilds of the accusation that they were responsible for a lengthy crisis since they were crucial in a deeper and quite well-defined process of reorganization.',\n",

Had this process increased the degree of concentration we would have expected greater credit rationing for small firms,  given the central role of Italian banks in financing small firms. We measure this change through widely used measures of concentration on branches.  First,  we observe  a steady increase in concentration that can be captured only by looking at the overall size distribution.  Other measures do not perceive this change until the year 2007, when the very large banks merged. Second, by focusing on the banking groups that have been active players in M&As we do see a decline in concentration, since smaller players have caught up with the larger ones in terms of rate of size increase.  This contrasts with the role of the new entries and the disappearance of banks following mergers, that has increased the dispersion of market shares. The implications are that: i)  there is a credit termination risk due to the rise in active players’ size, but ii) credit rationing may not occur due to a substitution effect in credit supply from new entries.',\n",

This paper analyses the effects of energy reforms on the probability of households experiencing deprivation, defined as difficulty in paying the bills. We use two sets of micro-data. First, the European Community Household Panel (ECHP), a large EU survey, offers evidence on people who report having been unable to pay scheduled utility bills. We consider seven European countries: Denmark, Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, and eight ECHP waves (1994-2001), with around 28,000 observations.

Two popular models for this function are the half-normal model and the negative exponential model.

The most recent line of investigation criticizes the EKC hypothesis on more fundamental grounds, in that it stresses the lack of sufficient statistical testing of the empirical relationship and questions the very existence of the notion of EKC. Attention is in particular drawn on the stationarity properties of the series involved – per capita emissions or concentrations and per capita GDP – and, in case of presence of unit roots, on the cointegration property that must be present for the EKC to be a well-defined concept. Only at that point can the researcher ask whether the long-run relationship exhibits an inverted-U pattern. On the basis of panel integration and cointegration tests for sulfur, Stern (2002, 2003) and Perman and Stern (1999, 2003) have presented evidence and forcefully stated that the EKC hypothesis does not exist. In this paper we ask whether similar strong conclusions can be arrived at when carrying out tests of  system fractional integration and cointegration. As an example we use the controversial case of carbon dioxide emissions. The results show that more EKCs come back into life relative to traditional integration/cointegration tests.

Nevertheless, no previous study has modelled the coal demand in China at provincial level. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we estimate and forecast the Chinese demand for coal using panel data disaggregated by provinces and accounting for spatial heterogeneity. Second, given the spatial nature of the data, we explicitly capture the spatial autocorrelation among provinces using spatial econometrics. In particular, we specify the Chinese industrial coal demand at provincial level with a fixed-effect spatial lag model and a fixed-effect spatial error model. The fixed- effect spatial lag model seems to better capture the existing interdependence between provinces. This model forecasts an average annual increase in coal demand to 2010 of 4 percent',\n",

This approach requires that each consumer, has a complete knowledge of the utility function and has got the computational skills for solving an optimization problem. Many authors, from \"bounded rationality\" perspective, argue that these assumptions are too strong and propose decisional mechanisms based on repeated choices following a dynamic adaptive process. The convergence, in the long run, of this adaptive process to the equilibrium point of the traditional static consumer model may be seen as an \"evolutionary explanation\" of the assumption of rational behaviour. We present a simple dynamic model that describes an adaptive decisional mechanism by assuming that at each time period the consumers update their choices in the direction of increasing/decreasing utility; the corresponding static traditional consumer framework is represented by Cobb-Douglas preferences with two goods. In discrete time evolution, we obtain an one-dimensional map when the preference parameter is exogenous otherwise an two-dimensional map, whose steady states represent the choices of the rational consumer. In the first one-dimensional model the rational choice is asymptotically stable when the weight given to each good is not too strong, otherwise we have the traditional transition to complex dynamics with a sequence of flip bifurcations. In the two-dimensional model there are several coexisting equilibria, that is, a \"multistability\" situation, where the final outcome depends on the initial conditions. In this situations the global analysis of the basins of attraction has a crucial importance; for this purpose we apply some recently introduced methods for the study of two-dimensional map with denominator, based on the notion of \"focal points\"',\n",

In order to obtain some insight into this question, two dynamicCournot duopoly games are considered, whose dynamics are represented by discrete-timedynamical systems. For each of these models, the dynamical behavior of the duopoly systemwith identical producers is compared to that with quasi-identical ones, in order to study theeffects of small heterogeneities between the players. In the case of identical players, suchdynamical systems become symmetric, and this implies that synchronized dynamics can beobtained, governed by a simpler one-dimensional model whose dynamics summarizes thecommon behavior of the two identical players. In both the examples, we show that a negligibledifference between the parameters that characterize the two producers can give dynamicevolutions that are qualitatively different from that of the symmetric game, i.e. a breakingof the symmetry can cause a noticeable effect. The presence of such bifurcations suggeststhat economic systems with quasi-identical agents may evolve quite differently from systemswith truly identical agents. This contrasts with the assumption, very common in the economicliterature, that small heterogeneities of agents do not matter too much',\n",

Despite this international recommendation, Italy still does not have mandatory regulations or guidelines to deal with radon in dwellings. Monitoring surveys have been undertaken in a number of western European countries in order to assess the exposure of people to this radioactive gas and to identify radon prone areas. However, such campaigns provide concentration values in each single dwelling included in the sample, while it is often necessary to provide measures of the pollutant concentration which refer to sub-areas of the region under study.

On the other hand when the demand function is concave, the unique critical point is a maximum: there can be stability or instability of the critical point and period two cycles around it via a flip bifurcation.

In this paper, we propose a new approach towards studying the following issues: (i) we analyse the existence and the impact of aspiration biases on workers levels of job satisfaction; and, (i) we analyse whether workers adapt to conditions shedding light on the relationship existing between aspiration biases and working conditions actually experienced in the job place. These issues are empirically studied using the 2005 European Working Condition Survey (EWCS). We find that aspiration biases exist. On average, divergence between individual working conditions and the upper aspiration bounds has stronger effect in reducing job satisfaction than the distance between the lower aspiration bounds and reality in increasing job satisfaction. Finally, aspiration biases seem to be positively affected by good working conditions and negatively affected by bad working conditions.\",\n",

The indicator is extracted from three time series concerning the production level and the domestic and foreign order book as declared by some 250 Assolombarda associates. This indicator is potentially very valuable in itself, being the Milan area one of the most dynamic economic systems in Italy and Europe, but it becomes much more interesting when compared to the Italian business cycle as extracted from the Italian industrial production index. Indeed, notwithstanding the deep differences in the nature of the data, the indicator for Milan has an extremely high coherence with the Italian cycle and the former leads the latter by approximately 4-6 months. Furthermore there is a direct relation between the amplitude of the cycle and the leading time of the Milan indicator. The ability of the Milan indicator to predict in real time the turning points of the Italian business cycle is tested through a simple forecasting exercise.',\n",

The methodology we propose allows dividing the impact of exogenous injections into four different effects: directdirect effect (D-D); direct-indirect effect (D-I); indirect-direct effect (I-D) and indirect-indirect effect (I-I). Results using the 2000 Vietnamese SAM show that the highest direct effects on the income of household groups are related to exogenous injections into the agricultural sector, while the highest indirect effects result from investing in other agriculture-related sectors such as, for example, food processing. Policy interventions focusing on the agricultural sector and on rural households will thus have the greatest effect on reducing the level of income inequality.',\n",

More generally, there are many indexes (such as the ordinal entropy) that can be properly employed to measure the ordinal dispersion. On the other hand, student ratings are often converted into scores and treated as a quantitative variable. More generally, it is possible to measure student satisfaction by means of a real-valued function defined on the standard simplex and satisfying some appropriate conditions.

We assume that solidarity is accorded by a network of individuals close enough to the borrower (peers) so as to share private information about hidden effort in the productive project. The model shows that peer solidarity might have contrasting e¤ects on the effort in the productive investment. On the one hand, since solidarity transfers are contingent on the effort, they increase borrower's incentive to invest. On the other hand, solidarity tranfers decrease the marginal utility of future consumption at the expense of productive investment. The predictions of the model are tested on households enrolled in micro-lending programs who were surveyed in Bangladesh by the World Bank during the period 1991-1992.

The procedure represents a probabilistic tool to quantitatively assess the ecotoxicological risk on biodiversity considering the distribution of toxicological sensitivity. It can be applied to assess chemical risk on generic aquatic and terrestrial communities as well as on site-specific natural communities. Examples of its application are shown for some pesticides in freshwater ecosystems. In order to overcome the problem of insufficient reliable ecotoxicological data, a methodology and related algorithms are proposed for predicting SSD curves for chemicals that do not have sufficient available data.

Second, is it possible to build more accurate quantitative models which are capable of predicting the future effects of different climate conditions on the transmissibility of particularly dangerous infectious diseases? The primary goal of this paper is to review the most relevant contributions which have directly tackled those questions, both with respect to the effects of climate changes on the diffusion of non-infectious and infectious diseases, with malaria as a case study. Specific attention will be drawn on the methodological aspects of each study, which will be classified according to the type of quantitative model considered, namely time series models, panel data and spatial models, and non-statistical approaches.

Globalisation has produced deep changes in the function and role of the system of corporate information flows, which is expressed in the adoption of an integrated communication strategy. The gradual integration of global markets tends to eliminate static contexts and to replace them with dynamic and unstable environments, which generate huge changes even in the field of corporate communication, specifically with regard to the goals pursuable, the forms and instruments usable and obviously the audiences that can be reached. Basically, integrated corporate communication: pursues the development of a culture of integrated communication; sustains the adoption by the organisation of behaviour and the practice of integrated communication; preserves the strong autonomy of the different operating units; and finally, it refers the concrete realisation of corporate network programmes to individual operating units.',\n",

In a complex framework of relationships, corporate governance communication and information are of prime importance to manage consensus in organisations operating on global markets. We can identify three main approaches in the debate on corporate governance communication. The first typically focuses on the shareholder supremacy of corporate policies. This approach in today’s global markets it often finds concrete implementation in companies operating in conditions of competitive scarcity (typical examples of this are corporations operating in oil extraction, energy and similar markets). The second approach refers to the balance between shareholder supremacy and stakeholder interest. In today’s global markets, this policy emerges in conditions of controlled competition, where corporate governance reveals a management power that is absolutely not subordinated to the shareholders. And finally, the third corporate governance policy concerns the conduct of organisations operating with a stakeholder supremacy. This approach is quite recent, developing in the early 1980s due to the globalisation of the markets of large corporations, which introduced networking logics into their corporate policies, tackling new problems of economic and environmental sustainability, with the result that new needs related to more heterogeneous and complex classes of stakeholders have emerged.',\n",

The main source of radon is the soil, but the gas can enter buildings in many different ways and reach high indoor concentrations. Monitoring surveys have been promoted in many countries in order to assess the exposure of people to radon. In this paper, two complementary aspects are investigated. Firstly, we mapped indoor radon concentration in a large and inhomogeneous region using a geostatistical approach which borrows strength from the geologic nature of the soil. Secondly, knowing that geologic and anthropogenic factors, such as building characteristics, can foster the gas to flow into a building or protect against this, we evaluated these effects through a multiple regression model which takes into account the spatial correlation of the data. This allows us to rank different building typologies, identified by architectonic and geological characteristics, according to their proneness to radon. Our results suggest the opportunity to differentiate construction requirements in a large and inhomogeneous area, as the one considered in this paper, according to different places and provide a method to identify those dwellings which should be monitored more carefully.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Line transect sampling is a distance sampling method widely used for estimating wildlife population density. Since the usual approach assumes a model for the detection function, the estimate depends on the shape of such a function. In particular, the estimate is influenced by the so-called shoulder condition, which ensures that detection is nearly certain at small distances from the line transect. For instance, the halfnormal model satisfies this condition, whereas the negative exponential model does not. So, testing whether the shoulder condition is consistent with the data represents a fundamental issue. The aim of this paper is to propose an admissible test for the shoulder condition in the exponential mixture model of the half-normal and the negative exponential.

We prove that the rank KPSS statistic shares the same limiting distribution as the standard KPSS statistic under the null and diverges under I(1) alternatives. For the trend-stationarity hypothesis, we apply the same rank KPSS statistic to the residuals of a Theil–Sen regression on a linear trend. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the Theil–Sen estimator under short memory errors and prove that the Theil–Sen detrended rank KPSS statistic shares the same weak limit as the least-squares detrended KPSS. We study the asymptotic relative efficiency of our test compared to the KPSS and prove that it may have unbounded efficiency gains under fat-tailed distributions compensated by very moderate efficiency losses under thin-tailed distributions. For this and other reasons discussed in the body of the article our rank KPSS test turns out to be a valuable alternative to the KPSS for most real-world economic and financial applications. The weak convergence results and asymptotic representations proved in this article should interest a wider audience than that concerned with stationarity testing, as they extend to ranks analogous invariance principles widely used in unit-root econometrics',\n",

These pivotal suppliers are expected to sell at monopolistic prices on their portions of the market demand. In this paper, we show that these market conditions may imply the non-concavity in prices of the pivotal supply function, which in turn means that there can be situations in which a pivotal operator's supply has virtually no price limits. We also show that this monopolistic market power can be significantly reduced by vertical integration and/or regulatory policies such as virtual power plants. Based on these results, we propose a simple price-capping rule that induces the pivotal operator to compete for quantity instead of taking advantage of its monopoly. Then, we infer the profit function of the Italian pivotal operator (Enel) for the sample period 2007-2010 using real auction data and cost curves employed by engineers.

The author tests whether changes occurring to the capital structure of such different types of intermediaries unevenly affect their behaviour in terms of risk-taking efficiency. Design/methodology/approach - The paper conducts an empirical analysis using data for the period 2001-2011 by means of both standard regression methods and stochastic cost frontier techniques. Findings - Results provide evidence that more capitalized Islamic banks are associated to less risky positions in terms of their asset structure. In particular, the latter exhibit higher liquidity standards and a lower incidence of non-performing loans compared to other banks. This has delayed positive effects on profitability and no substantial impact on efficiency. On the other hand, highly capitalized conventional banks tend to shift from more traditional lending activities to investment in other (profit generating) assets. Such strategy increases profitability and efficiency, although raising impaired loans. Research limitations/implications - This study does not address potential endogeneity concerns that might affect the variables at stake, hence mainly providing indications in terms of correlation between phenomena rather than causality. Practical implications - The analysis has important practical implications when considering capital adequacy as a regulatory tool for managing the risk of Islamic banks' activity, following principles similar to those recommended by the Basel committee.

Methods: We performed a prospective 6-year follow-up cohort study, with recruitment between 2003 and 2004, and the follow-up completed in 2010. The setting was an ambulatory care/day surgery. Of 209 consecutive patients who underwent endovenous laser ablation at our institution during the recruitment period, five (2.4%) did not complete the procedure due to technical reasons. Of 204 patients who successfully completed the intervention, 14 (6.8%) were lost for follow-up, and 190 completed the planned 6-year follow-up.

Compared to controls, bvFTD data showed retention of major \"hub\" regions in the medial parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes, but cortical hubs were not noted in the frontal lobes. Medial and dorsal frontal regions, left caudate nucleus, left insular cortices, and some regions of the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes showed decreased nodal centrality. BvFTD patients showed the greatest decrease in inter-regional connectivity between the frontal and occipital regions, and the insular cortices and occipital, temporal, subcortical, and frontal regions. In bvFTD, altered global network properties correlated with executive dysfunction. Conclusions: Global and local functional networks are altered in bvFTD, suggesting a loss of efficiency in information exchange between both distant and close brain areas. Altered brain regions are located in structures that are closely associated with neuropathologic changes in bvFTD. Aberrant topology of the functional brain networks in bvFTD appears to underlie cognitive deficits in these patients.',\n",

We show that securitization can be part of the optimal financing scheme for banks, provided banks retain an equity tranche in the sold loans to maintain proper incentives. In economic downturns however securitization should be restricted. The implementation of the optimal solvency scheme is achieved by setting appropriate capital charges through a form of capital insurance, protecting the value of bank capital in downturns, while providing additional liquidity in upturns',\n",

However, it is not simply market fragmentation as such that produces this result, but rather the entity of the “prize” that innovators can gain relative to the overall size of the market. Further, the model shows that emerging industry leaders are innovative early entrants in large submarkets. The key question concerns the observation that—despite high degrees ofR&D and marketing-intensity—concentration has been consistently low during the whole evolution of the industry. Standard explanations of this phenomenon refer to the random nature of the innovative process, the patterns of imitation, and the fragmented nature of the market into multiple, independent submarkets. We delve deeper into this issue by using an improved version of our previous “history-friendly” model of the evolution of pharmaceuticals. Thus, we explore the way in which changes in the technological regime and/or in the structure of demand may generate or not substantially higher degrees of concentration.',\n",

Second, it aims at contributing to a more general methodological discussion about agent-based models by proposing an econometric analysis of the results of the simulations. The case of the pharmaceutical industry has been studied extensively by scholars because, despite the high level of R&D intensity, the industry has been characterized by a relatively low levels of concentration. The model is able to reproduce the main stylized facts of the industry in an evolutionary perspective. In this paper we extend the analysis conducted in two previous works (Garavaglia et al. 2012, 2013) by further qualifying the findings with an extensive econometric investigation of the model outputs. The paper focuses the attention on the determinants of market structure, the innovative performance of the industry, the diversification in multiple submarkets and the level of prices. We find that the properties of the technological and demand regimes are key determinants of the patterns of industry evolution and that the main mechanisms driving the model are the random processes of search, the discovery of new submarkets as well as the interactions between patent protection, imitation and price competition. In addition, this paper emphasizes how the emerging leaders in the industry are those innovative early entrants which entered in large submarkets, showing the importance of the first mover advantage and of the size of the \"prize\" accruing to innovators when they discover a new rich submarket',\n",

Since the usual approach assumes a model for the detection function, the estimate depends on the shape of such a function.

For instance, the half-normal model satisfies this condition, whereas the negative exponential model does not.

Typically, this problem has been dealt with the use of Cohen’s weighted kappa, which is a modification of the original kappa statistic, proposed for nominal variables in the case of two observers. Fleiss (1971) put forth a generalization of kappa in the case of multiple observers, but both Cohen’s and Fleiss’ kappa could have a paradoxical behavior, which may lead to a difficult interpretation of their magnitude. In this paper, a modification of Fleiss’ kappa, not affected by paradoxes, is proposed, and subsequently generalized to the case of ordinal variables. Monte Carlo simulations are used both to testing statistical hypotheses and to calculating percentile and bootstrap-t confidence intervals based on this statistic. The normal asymptotic distribution of the proposed statistic is demonstrated. Our results are applied to the classical Holmquist et al.’s (1967) dataset on the classification, by multiple observers, of carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix.

       "  'abstract': \"The current debate on urban regeneration and competitiveness is all the more significant when it makes possible to understand the development of new industrial clusters, the dynamics of growth, and the consequent new spaces that are being created in a metropolis. Some of this debate call for a break with past interpretations with regard on the one side to systems and practices dealing with territorial production, occupation, and exploitation, and on the other to those politics of urban management that try to identify, keep, and exploit its creative potential. In an enclosed space, such as a district, a city, or an area within the city, creative potential is intimately linked to the degree of knowledge and innovation, let alone the kind of cultural opportunities that space provides. Paradoxically, the most obvious limits to the exploitation of any space derives from the public authorities' inability to do away with past practices, industrial patters, and traditional ways of doing. On a global scale, the trend seems to be that of first creating and then promoting creative and cultural circuits in urban spaces in accordance with competitiveness and value production criteria. These strategies have multiple objectives. These range from the more intangible ones, such as finding a role for a city or an area within the knowledge economy, to the more measurable ones, such as those that show immediate economic results. Different criteria and means can be used to evaluate the achievement of the stated objectives. To be sure, standard do exist that enable the evaluation of achievements, such as statistical reports that rank cities and regions on an international scale. The visibility, perception, and image of a certain place, then, together with its attractiveness, is directly influenced to the impact of such evaluations and rankings. This article examines the current transformation of the city of Milan within the above-described interpretive framework. Such transformations are often directly linked to creative and cultural representations. This article places and examines contemporary art at the centre of these transformations. Art, and contemporary art in particular, could play a most beneficial role in the city's regeneration.\",\n",

We assess the outcome of patients with MELD < 18 awaiting LT, finding prognostic variables to iden- tify a high dropout risk. Methods: Training set consisted of 277 patients and validation cohort of 292 patients. Competing risk regression analysis, taking into account LT, was used for univariate/multivariate analysis. Results: Asci- tes, sodium, bilirubin, albumin and glomerular filtration rate were indepen- dently associated with a 12-month dropout risk in the training set. Combining these five prognostic parameters, we calculated a new score named liver-renal-risk (LIRER).

We identify four main gaps to fill in the existing equity-in-compensation research: i) the simultaneous analysis of internal and external inequity; ii) the distinction between inequitable and unequal compensation systems; iii) the organizational-level (rather than individual) effects of inequitable systems; and iv) the inclusion of absenteeism among the negative organizational outcomes of inequitable systems. The analysis of a sample of about 1500 Italian manufacturing firms shows that both internal and external equity are relevant factors in explaining the level of absenteeism. On the one hand, external pay equity is associated with a lower level of absenteeism, and the relationship becomes stronger when high pay levels are explained by past employees’ performances. On the other hand, internal pay equity showed a more complex relationship, where blue-collar employees seem to react more in terms of absence to internal inequity than white-collars; moreover, performance-based pay policies (i.e. explained inequalities) further enhance the extent blue-collar employees react to internal pay equity.

We first concentrated on data from the British Isles and then expanded the models to western Europe and north Africa. We produced maps of the progression of migration that disclosed local patterns of migration consistent with those obtained from the analyses of the movements of ringed individuals. Timing of migration estimated from our model is consistent with data on migration phenology of the Barn Swallow available in the literature, but in some cases it is later than that estimated by data collected at ringing stations, which, however, may not be representative of migration phenology over large geographical areas. The comparison of median migration date estimated over the same geographical area among time periods showed no significant advancement of spring migration over the whole of Europe, but a significant advancement of autumn migration in southern Europe. Our modelling approach can be generalized to any records of ringing date and locality of individuals including those which have not been recovered subsequently, as well as to geo-referenced databases of sightings of migratory individuals',\n",

We study fixed-prize contests in a 2 × 2 experimental design, varying orthogonally the degree of competition of the incentive mechanism (all-pay auction vs. lottery) and the presence or absence of social returns to bidding (public good vs. rent seeking). The results indicate that both stronger competition and the presence of the public good have positive main effects on bids. More importantly, we find a negative interaction between stronger competition and the presence of the public good, leading us to reject separability. These findings provide causal evidence that economic incentives may negatively affect pro-social behavior.

In these firms, entrepreneurship is influenced by the inherent characteristics of the craftsman as well as by the number of generations involved in the firm. We suggest that these variables affect both entrepreneurship and firm growth. Methodology: We adopt OLS regression on a sample of 52 small artistic artisan family firms using a dependent variable (ROE), four independent variables (entrepreneurship, age, tenure, generations involved) and two control variables (firm size and gender). Findings: Our results show that 1) the inherent characteristics of the entrepreneur-craftsman do not affect entrepreneurship within those firms; 2) the generations involved in the firms affect entrepreneurship and 3) entrepreneurship affects the growth of family firms. Research limits: Some limitations regard the size of the sample and the number of independent variables used. Practical implications: Our findings provide some suggestions in understanding why some artistic artisan family firms grow whilst other stagnate, suggesting that the entrepreneurial behavior of the craftsman plays a key role. Originality of the paper: A consideration of the potential effects of inherent characteristics of the entrepreneur and the generations involved as antecedents of entrepreneurship for the growth of small artistic -artisan family firms is largely absent from the entrepreneurship literature.',\n",

The theoretical models used in the more recent economic literature (Coelho and McClure, 1993; Corneo and Jeanne, 1997; Karni and Schmeidler, 1990; Matsuyama, 1992; Stigler and Becker, 1977) have the undeniable advantage of making the cycle widely applicable, and consequently appropriate for the analysis of the most varied fields of consumption activity. However, in the process, the originality of Simmel's thought has been lost. Since they are built on the principles of standard economics, the above-mentioned models generally assume that preferences are exogenous and overlook the fact that individual tastes change in time, partly in line with choices previously made by the social group. The present paper proposes a model of the fashion cycle in which conspicuous consumption 'snob' and 'bandwagon' preferences (Leibenstein, 1950) are determined endogenously and depend on previous consumption experience, both personal and that of other consumers. Thus the particular contribution of this work in comparison to the preceding economic literature is dual in nature. By assuming preferences to be endogenous, it reflects more accurately the dynamics causing perpetual motion in the fashion cycle. By assuming preferences to be shaped through the social interaction of a heterogeneous community of individuals, the model manages to identify more closely the psycho-sociological nuances that, according to Simmel, give rise to the cycle.\",\n",

By means of correspondence analysis, the main concepts expressed by patients were identified, and the association between patients and concepts was represented in an appropriate metric space.

In the 20th century the growth of Milan encompassed other suburbs, that previous were still autonomous, and then, after the second world war, the suburbs were interested by an extraordinary growth thanks to the migration flows towards Milan in the decades of the Italian economic miracle. In this period the suburbs have changed once again, with the predominance of dwelling places, while industrial settlements lost rapidly their importance.

Agents may switch between optimism and pessimism according to which behavior is more profitable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first contribution considering both real and financial interacting markets and an evolutionary selection process for which an analytical study is performed. Indeed, employing analytical and numerical tools, we detect the mechanisms and the channels through which the stability of the isolated real and financial sectors leads to instability for the two interacting markets. In order to perform such analysis, we introduce the \"interaction degree approach\", which allows us to study the complete three-dimensional system by decomposing it into two subsystems, i.e., the isolated financial and real markets, easier to analyze, that are then linked through a parameter describing the interaction degree between the two markets. We derive the stability conditions both for the isolated markets and for the whole system with interacting markets. Next, we show how to apply the interaction degree approach to our model. Among the various scenarios we are led to analyze, the most interesting one is that in which the isolated markets are stable, but their interaction is destabilizing. We choose such setting to give an economic interpretation of the model and to explain the rationale for the emergence of boom and bust cycles.

More precisely, we introduce such mechanism into a financial market model in which the price dynamics are described by a sigmoidal price adjustment mechanism characterized by the presence of two asymptotes that bound the price variation and thus the dynamics.

Frequency of detection, concentration range, spatial distribution pattern, and temporal trend of contaminant concentration in each aquifer were analyzed as well as the relationships between VOC concentrations and the total amount of precipitation during the 90 days preceding each sampling date. A review of published ecotoxicological data, providing an indication of the biological risk associated with the observed levels of VOC contamination,was presented and discussed. BTEX concentrations were under detection limits in all the investigated aquifers, indicating absence of contamination. In contrast, CAH contamination occurred in 14 out of 17 aquifers.

No significant temporal trendwas observed for chloroformand tetrachloroethene concentrations during the six years of observation, indicating the persistence of stable contaminations, except for some slightly decreasing trends observed in three out of 17 aquifers. In four aquifers chloroform and tetrachloroethene concentrations increasedwith precipitations in the preceding months. Spatial patterns of contamination differed among aquifers, indicating highly complex contaminant distributions at aquifer scale not related to single-plume geometries. Patterns of contamination by chloroform and tetrachloroethene in the most urbanized aquiferswere likely associated with multiple sources of VOCs not clearly detectable at the scale used in this study. In five out of 17 aquifers, chloroform and tetrachloroethene co-occurred at concentrations that are lethal to groundwaterdwelling organisms under a short exposure period (four days).

Drawing from data on 63 Italian SMEs, four archetypes of internationalization strategy are identified through a cluster analysis: 'marketer', 'investor', 'networker', and 'weak internationalizer'.

       "  'abstract': 'This paper analyses, by means of an economic experiment, the impact of a vertical review on third-party punishment. Whereas the existing empirical literature has studied, under many different aspects, third-party costly punishment as such, it has not addressed the impact of a second “instance” (competent to overrule punishment decisions by the first punisher) on the incidence and amount of such first-instance punishment and the underlying unwanted behaviour (“stealing”). In this paper, we apply experimental methodology that allows us to construct in the lab the counterfactual context for a direct institutional comparison that we cannot find in real life. In particular, we examine first of all whether and how the presence of a second “vertical” punishment layer (i.e. of a “second instance”) affects the amount of punishment imposed in the first instance. Secondly, we check whether the presence of a second level of punishment has a deterrent effect on the underlying (undesired) behaviour. Finally, we examine the level of satisfaction of the victims in all scenarios. In our experiments, we find that the introduction of a second (vertical) tier of punishment increases (i) the level of punishment provided for in the first instance, (ii) deterrence with regard to the underlying behaviour (i.e. a reduction in the number of “thefts” being committed), and also (iii) the level of satisfaction for victims. Real-world applications of this study are plentiful, including the organisation of courts and the appeals process as a whole. Our evidence confirms that the presence of an “instance” (a second tier of legal decision making) is, other things equal, likely to generate beneficial effects',\n",

Moreover, in contrast to available DCC methods, SP-DCC allows for straightforward estimation also for the non-symultaneous case, i.e. for the estimation of conditional cross-covariances and correlations, displaced at any time horizon of interest. A simple ex-post procedure to ensure well behaved conditional variance-covariance and correlation matrices, grounded on nonlinear shrinkage, is finally proposed.

Findings – Gender diversity, as measured by the percentage of women on a board and by the Blau and the Shannon indices, has a positive and significant effect on Tobin’s Q, while the presence of one or more women on the board per se has an insignificant effect on firm financial performance. Practical implications – The results suggest that (a) board gender diversity is not a simple ‘numbers game’, (b) greater gender diversity may generate economic gains, (c) greater gender diversity does not destroy shareholder value, (d) investors do not penalize companies that increase female representation on their boards, (e) Italian companies should focus their efforts on the right mix of men and women rather than on simply the presence of at least one woman on a board of directors.

Idiosyncratic shocks hitting the banking industry generate non-negligible effects on the rest of the economy, but their impact on wages and the rental rate of capital is rather small. The pro-cyclicality of the banking sector is therefore unlikely to feed back strongly to economic activity in the absence of large wealth effects on household. Positive productivity shocks hitting the industrial sector induce sizable increases of the rate on loans and sharp increases in the total hours worked in the banking system. Economy-wide negative technological shocks do indeed generate losses in the banking industry that are not only substantial but are proportionally larger than in the industrial sector.

We compare three different expectation mechanisms: Perfect foresight, myopic foresight, and adaptive expectations, focusing, in particular, on this last one. We show that the steady state is the same under each mechanism, and we prove its global stability for perfectly foresighted agents. After investigating local stability conditions under myopic expectations, we study in detail the case of adaptive expectations. We show that, under both reduced rationality mechanisms, if the share of time devoted to labor in the second period of life is large enough, periodic and complex dynamics can occur. Moreover, deepening the investigation through numerical simulations, we study the global stability behavior under adaptive expectations. Such complex scenarios also include the coexistence between the stable steady state and a periodic or chaotic attractor, giving rise to multistability, which does not arise under myopic expectations. Finally, we provide some considerations about the possibility for the agents to improve their forecasts by observing the forecasting error time series\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Assessing a territory’s fire proneness is fundamental when planning and undertaking effective forest protection and land management. Accurate methods to estimate the risk of fire ignition in natural environments have been proposed over the last decades and digital mapping has been used to identify critical areas. The Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index is a well-known fire danger rating index created and improved during the last 45 years by the Canadian Forest Service. The goal of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we evaluated whether the Forest FireWeather Index is an adequate instrument to predict fire ignition in Alpine and sub-Alpine areas using quite a large dataset of meteorological and forest fire data collected in the Lombardy region (Northern Italy) between 2003 and 2011. By means of a spatial binary regression model, we demonstrated that Forest FireWeather Index has a significant impact on the probability of fire ignition. Since this approach allows us to account for other characteristics of the territory in order to provide a more accurate estimate of the spatial wildfire dynamics at a moderately large scale, the second goal of the paper aims at creating a model to assess fire risk occurrence using the Forest Fire Weather Index and land use information. It has been found that ignition can easily occur in large forested areas whereas denser urban areas are less exposed to fire since they usually have no fuels to ignite. Nevertheless, since human activity has a direct impact on fire ignition human presence, it fosters ignition in forested areas. Finally, the model, including these spatial dimensions, has been employed to derive a probability map of fire occurrences at 1.5km resolution, which is a fundamental instrument to develop optimal prevention and risk management policy plans for the decision maker.',\n",

Anal. 114: 412–426, 2013) makes it possible to preserve many theoretical properties of the Dirichlet one, without inheriting its lack of flexibility in modeling the various independence concepts appropriate for compositional data, i.e. data representing vectors of proportions. In this paper we tackle the potential of the FD from an inferential and applicative viewpoint. In this regard, the key feature appears to be the special structure defining its Dirichlet mixture representation. This structure determines a simple and clearly interpretable differentiation among mixture components which can capture the main features of a large variety of data sets. Furthermore, it allows a substantially greater flexibility than the Dirichlet, including both unimodality and a varying number of modes. Very importantly, this increased flexibility is obtained without sharing many of the inferential difficulties typical of general mixtures. Indeed, the FD displays the identifiability and likelihood behavior proper to common (non-mixture) models. Moreover, thanks to a novel non random initialization based on the special FD mixture structure, an efficient and sound estimation procedure can be devised which suitably combines EM-types algorithms.

The study follows, in particular, a previous study conducted by Mariani and Mussini (2013) based on Fondazione di Venezia data, with a view to better contextualization level. Previous studies have examined the role of museums in enhancing the image of a destination and in attracting and conveying additional tourists’ fluxes, arguing that although not all museums are a destination of choice for visitors, a great museum or a strong exhibition program still does represent a national and international attraction. This paper overturns this argument investigating whereas an appealing location (such as a tourist destination) can influence prospective visitors about the level of attractiveness of a pay cultural event taking place therein. A questionnaire was developed and data were collected at the Palazzo Ducale in Venice, Italy, in 2007, during the art exhibition “Venezia e l’Islam 829-1797”, via 501 face-to-face visitors interviews. The research model analyzes data through the conjoint analysis and the descriptive statistics. Results show that the exhibition location has been a relevant factor in influencing the visitors’ decision process linked to the attendance of the event. Data show that, for the majority of visitors, the exhibition had been located elsewhere, they would not have visited it. Thus, an appealing location or a structured tourist destination may function as an attractive platform that may contribute to enforce the overall visitor’s satisfaction with regard to his or her attendance to a cultural event. Furthermore, such a fact depends on specific objective variables (e.g., level of education, age), although no significant differences were reported between segments based on other socio-demographic characteristics such as sex. To conclude, arts and cultural managers should market and position cultural events in locations that can function as attractive, thus as emotionally driven experience consumption sites. Furthermore, they should consider both the cognitive and the emotional aspects of visitor’s experience when designing and planning their events, as well as when assessing visitor’s satisfaction. Cognitive and emotional aspects should be considered simultaneously when measuring visitors’ satisfaction. In shaping visitors’ satisfaction, emotions, such as the pleasure to be in a particular location, are more significant than cognitive aspects, such as the theme of the exhibition',\n",

Instead, an increase in posting from abroad may raise domestic labour costs. No significant effects are found on sending country labour market variables. Results point towards the development of possible synergies between domestic and posted workers, so that posting can actually improve labour efficiency and put upward pressure on labour costs.',\n",

Firms are also assumed to face resource or financial constraints in adjusting their production levels, so that, from time to time, they can only increase or decrease their strategy by a bounded quantity. We consider different families of oligopolies of generic sizes, characterized by heterogeneous compositions with respect to the rationality degrees of firms. We analytically study the local stability of the equilibrium depending on the oligopoly size and composition and through numerical simulations we investigate the possible dynamics arising when trajectories do not converge toward the equilibrium. We show that in this case complex dynamics can arise, and this is due to both the loss of stability of the equilibrium and to the emergence of multiple attractors, with the stable steady state coexisting with a different, periodic or chaotic, attractor. In particular, we show that multistability phenomena occur when the overall degree of rationality of the oligopoly is increased.

From 1905, their choice of setting up their plants caused a sudden increase in the population, which was followed by an equally sharp increase in the demand for lodgings and social infrastructures. The employers were forced to invest in building, at first with the intention of rapidly housing the workers, and then to proceed with a more rational planning of specific villages for the workforce. In the decades between the wars, Sesto San Giovanni was provided with a wide range of services in the fields of health care, schooling and even leisure. These policies permitted the creation of solid, close-knit company communities, founded on the intense participation of the workforce in the functioning of production activities. The social network, however, held together principally on the basis of the recognition of mutual obligations and responsibilities, rather than on mere subordination to paternalistic domination',\n",

Consecutive patients with chronic, symptomatic GSV or SSV insufficiency were treated by EVLA with a 1470-nm diode laser and a radial fiberoptic. Patients were recruited between 2008 and 2011, and the follow-up was completed in 2012. All patients underwent clinical and echo color Doppler evaluations during follow-up. The primary outcome was the incidence of echo color Dopplerconfirmed failures during follow-up. We also investigated potential associations between failures and patients' characteristics, echo color Doppler findings, or surgical features. The secondary outcome was the postoperative pain course.Results: The planned 12-month follow-up was completed in 372 patients. Echo color Doppler-confirmed failures occurred in 37 (12%) of 310 patients with GSV insufficiency, whereas none of 62 patients with SSVinsufficiency experienced a failure. Multiple Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed a significant association of failures with a Clinical, Etiologic, Anatomic, and Pathologic class C ≥4 and a mean confluence of the superficial inguinal veins diameter ≥9mmin patients with GSV insufficiency.

Proposed transfers are a polynomial function of the difference between actual and desired pollution levels; moreover, they are designed so that in MPE no tax or subsidy is ever levied. Their applicability under stochastic pollution dynamics is studied for a symmetric game of polluting oligopolists with linear demand. We discuss a quadratic scheme that induces agents to adopt Markovian emission strategies that are stationary and linearly decreasing in total pollution. Total expected ambient transfers are non-positive and their magnitude is linearly increasing in physical volatility, the size of the economy, and the absolute value of the slope of the inverse demand function.

The main idea is to consider a vector of weights as an imaginary voter submitting preferences over alternatives. With this voting construct in mind, the well-known Kemeny rule from social choice theory is introduced as a means of aggregating the preferences of many plausible choices of weights, suitably weighted by the importance attached to them. The axiomatic characterization of Kemeny’s rule due to Young and Levenglick (1978) and Young (1988) extends to the present context.

Nonetheless, their use is controversial as they often rely on ad-hoc and theoretically problematic assumptions regarding normalization, aggregation, and weighting. Nonparametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods, originating in the production-economics literature, have been proposed as a means of addressing these concerns. These methods dispense with contentious normalization and weighting techniques by focusing on a measure of best-case relative performance. Recently, the standard DEA model for composite indicators was extended to account for worst-case analysis by Zhou et\\xa0al. (Ecol Econ 62(2):291–297, 2007) [hereafter, ZAP]. In this note we argue that, while valid and interesting in its own right, the measure adopted by ZAP may not capture, in a mathematical as well as practical sense, the notion of worst-case relative performance. By contrast, we focus on the strict worst-case analogue of standard DEA for composite indicators and show how it leads to tractable optimization problems. Finally, we compare the two methodologies using data from ZAP’s Sustainable Energy Index case study, demonstrating that they occasionally lead to divergent results.',\n",

Justified envy considerations arise when two agents have the same initial endowment, or when an agent is in some sense disproportionately rewarded in comparison to her peers. For this general model, an algorithm is designed to find a fractional allocation of houses to agents that satisfies ordinal efficiency, individual rationality, and no justified envy. The analysis extends to the full preference domain. Individual rationality, ordinal efficiency, and no justified envy conflict with weak strategyproofness. Moreover, individual rationality, ordinal efficiency and strategyproofness are shown to be incompatible.

Based on the temporal trends available for many of the chemicals, the temporal trend of the mixture risk for bear cubs was calculated. Relative to the 1980s, a decrease in risk from the POP mixture is evident, mainly because of international control measures.

What is proposed is therefore a form of libertarian paternalism that has a dual valency. As paternalism, it aims to make up for citizens' irrational and self-harming tendencies by «gently nudging them» to decide rationally for their own good. In its libertarian form it aims to give the last word to the outcome of the conscious and deliberative processes of the individual citizen who can always choose to resist the nudge. Thaler and Sunstein's thesis is that citizens are subject to many deviations of rationality that bring them to make a decision that is against their own interests. This widespread irrationality is provoked by the automatic judgement and decision-making behaviour enabled by heuristics. Thaler and Sunstein's theses derive in part from the programme of behavioural economics commenced in the postwar period by Herbert Simon and continued in the 70s by Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky and their school. However, this approach is based on a distorted concept of bounded rationality focused on the study of the correspondence between judgement and decision-making performance in tests and laboratory simulations and canonical models of probabilistic and deductive rationality. As it is clear from the Simonian framework and from subsequent developments there are four attributes of the concept of bounded rationality that contrast with the current approach of behavioural economics that inspired Nudge theory. This is not a rationality that is interested in questions of form, but rather in the question of ecological adaptation to the environment of choice and problem-solving. It centres on the procedural and realistic attributes of rationality and not on instrumental and conventionalist ones. It recognises that the complexity of the real environment of choice brings the player face to face with decisions in conditions of uncertainty rather than risk. Last but not least, it appears sceptical regarding the ability to divide the mind into separate systems of the intuitive-unconscious type and the analytical-conscious type as it is supported by Thaler and Sunstein\",\n",

The marked similarity between the distribution of MLE before strong contamination of the time series and after decontamination through the WFS proves the reliability of the WFS estimator.

From a theoretical perspective, BoCE has been explained either by the misperception of chance, also known as the gambler’s fallacy, or by the loss repair effect. The aim of this paper is to look more closely at the former. We run a laboratory experiment in which the information set is relatively rich but the implementation of the Bayesian updating process is fairly simple. By doing so, we are able to elicit a range of consistent but heterogeneous probability beliefs and to distinguish between Bayesian and non-Bayesian subjects. We obtain two major results concerning Bayesian subjects. First, they exhibit a strong and robust short-run BoCE. Second, they are seemingly not affected by the audits of other taxpayers in their compliance decision. These results are robust to different definitions of Bayesianity as well as to different specifications and conflict with the evidence that Bayesian agents correctly perceive the chance of being audited. In turn, these findings suggest that the existing explanations of the BoCE are not satisfactory and that alternative theories are needed',\n",

We consider a nonlinear monetary policy rule which, in each period, bounds the money growth rate so that money is determined by the deviation of the inflation rate from its target. More precisely, we introduce such a mechanism through a sigmoidal money adjustment mechanism characterized by the presence of two asymptotes that bound the money variation, and thus the dynamics. It is shown that, depending on the timing of the monetary policy and the degree of reaction of the Central Bank, the target equilibrium may be destabilized via different types of bifurcations. Multistability and coexistence of attractors may also occur and the study of the basins of attraction allows us to analyze the global dynamic properties of the economy under scrutiny. We find that active monetary policy rules may be relevant for their stabilizing properties, but they also may open the door to equilibrium cycles of any periodicity and even chaos.',\n",

After presenting the model for a generic framework, we analytically study the case of cyclically alternating demand functions. We show that both the perturbation size and the agent’s reactivity to profitability variation signals can have counterintuitive roles on the resulting period-2 cycles and on their stability. In particu- lar, increasing the perturbation size can have both a destabilizing and a stabilizing effect on the resulting dynamics. Moreover, in contrast with the case of time-constant demand functions, the agent’s reactivity is not just destabilizing, but can improve stability, too. This means that a less cautious behavior can provide better performance, both with respect to stability and to achieved profits. We show that, even if the decision mechanism is very simple and is not able to always provide the optimal production decisions, achieved prof- its are very close to those optimal. Finally, we show that in agreement with the exist- ing empirical literature, the price series obtained simulating the proposed model exhibit a significant deviation from normality and large volatility, in particular when underlying deterministic dynamics become unstable and complex',\n",

By considering the pioneering groundbreaking approach of [2], we build a dynamical model of linear oligopolies where heterogeneous decision mechanisms of players are made explicit. In particular, we consider two different types of quantity setting players characterized by different decision mechanisms that coexist and operate simultaneously: agents that adap- tively adjust their choices towards the direction that increases their profit are embedded with imitator agents. The latter ones use a particular form of proportional imitation rule that considers the awareness about the presence of strategic interactions. It is noteworthy that the Cournot-Nash outcome is a stationary state of our models. Our thesis is that the chaotic dynamics arousing from a dynamical model, where heterogeneous players are con- sidered, are capable to qualitatively reproduce the outcomes of experimental oligopolies',\n",

We study how the responsiveness of the policy rule with respect to inflation affects the determinacy of the monetary equilibrium. A policy rule is called aggressive (moderate) if it responds strongly (moderately) to inflation deviations from the target. We show how aggressive feedback rules, depending on the considered timing, can reinforce mechanisms that lead to indeterminacy or may lead the inflation rate to fluctuate around the monetary equilibrium at which monetary policy is aggressive. A leaning against the wind policy seems to be more desirable from an equilibrium determinacy point of view.

In addition to borrowers' characteristics, we analyze the motivational issues that may influence the probability that the loan is fully or partially repaid, and the time horizon over which it is repaid. Empirical results show that the repayment rate improves as borrowers get closer to the loan limit, which is the maximum available loan.

Such nontrivial equilibrium may be stable, attracting all trajectories, or unstable. In the latter case, interesting, periodic, or chaotic, dynamics arise.

Under the conditional model, we recommend Fisher's test. For the unconditional model, amongst standard approximate methods, Liebermeister's tests come closest to controlling size.

A potential tourist to the Falls is not well informed online about issues related to sustainable tourism; his attention is likely not to be drawn to such issues, at least not explicitly. The results show there is plenty of room to improve the online communication value of an area recognised by UNESCO.

In some cases that is not possible and it might be necessary the selection of a subgrid extracted from the original network. Motivated by a real semiconductor problem, we propose a method to extract a monitoring subgrid from a given one, based upon grid representativeness, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the subgrid and, if available, by expert knowledge of the weights to be assigned to those areas where production may need greater precision. Discussion is mainly focused on circular spatial domain, since, in microelectronics, the basic production support, called wafer, is a circle. Straightforward generalizations to different spatial domains are possible. Furthermore, conditionally upon the availability of experimental data, we check the loss of accuracy by fitting a dual mean-variance response surface on the reduced grid. Joining the latter information and the criteria used to select the subgrid, we provide additional guidelines on how to fine-tune the subgrid selection.

Project leaders are key actors in a virtual community and are crucial to the success of the OSS model. Knowledge of the forces that lead to the emergence of project managers among the multitude of participants is still limited. We aim to fill this gap in the literature by analyzing the association between the roles played by an individual who is registered with a project, and a set of individual-level and project-level characteristics. In line with the theory of occupational choice elaborated by (Lazear, E.P., 2002. Entrepreneurship. NBER Working Paper No. 9109, Cambridge, Mass; Lazear, E.P., 2004. Balanced skills and entrepreneurship, American Economic Review 94, pp. 208-211), we find that OSS project leaders possess diversified skill sets which are needed to select the inputs provided by various participants, motivate contributors, and coordinate their efforts. Specialists, like pure developers, are endowed with more focused skill sets. Moreover, we find that the degree of modularity of the development process is positively associated with the presence of project leaders. That result is consistent with the modern theory of modular production (Baldwin, C.Y., Clark, K.B., 1997. Managing in an age of modularity.

We find direct and indirect effects of openness. In particular, we estimate that one standard deviation of the variables that compose our index of openness produce a 24% increase in regional income from its sample average. Of this, slightly more than one-third is produced by an indirect effect of openness coming through patents. This suggests that open regions tap into wider knowledge networks that then affect performance.

Results indicate that there can be positive repercussions deriving from luxury fashion brands and furniture design interconnections. In particular, associations with collectable furniture design may help to define and enhance brands’ luxury values whilst providing consumers with innovative and creative luxury brand experiences. Future expectations in this market show a compound annual rate (CAGR) of 3% to 4% through 2020, to just about €280 billion. This is dramatically slower than the past fast growth experienced from the mid-1990s to the late 2000s. In this scenario, luxury fashion managers and marketers must envision new strategies to succeed and surpass competition. In order to be competitive and successful, luxury brand managers must take into account current market dynamics and find pertinent and substantial solutions. This paper shifts its attention to the identification of how in such a difficult scenario different cultural industries can meet in order to mutually enhance their circuits of value. Some studies have demonstrated that in order to meet such new global challenges, luxury fashion firms may discover strategic opportunities in art (Codignola, 2016). Given their symbolic connotation and aesthetic value, high-end furniture design items are more and more perceived as art works exchanged in art auctions or fairs, collected and purchased by collectors, exhibited in galleries or museums. At the same time, furniture design goods show some divergences from conventional art works (i.e. functionality, reproducibility, etc.) and some correspondences with fashion goods. By observing the luxury fashion sector, one may then find--for different sets of reasons--more than one interesting intersection with the furniture design sector. By taking into account the furniture design sector within its specific market features and goods, this paper argues that through furniture design LFBs can develop engaging creative and innovative brands’ marketing communication strategies. Compared to art, such strategies would be able to add value and strengthen LFBs’ luxury features even in a more effective way.',\n",

Merging a unique panel data set on Argentinean firms in the 1990s with a data base on different types of public support received through the FONTAR (Fondo Tecnólogico Argentino) program, we estimate a fixed effects model and find evidence of a significant positive impact of FONTAR on private R&D. A 1 per cent increase in the amount received through FONTAR induces an average increase of 547.6 real pesos in annual R&D expenditures. The result is robust to the use of an instrumental variable estimator that controls for the potential bias induced by changes in the structure of the program. An analysis by type of financial support reveals that the impact is mainly due to targeted and fiscal credit with no evidence that funding received through matching grants has an additionality effect on private investments. This result is in line with the predictions of a simple theoretical model that investigates the impact of different policy interventions to promote investments in R&D. When firms’ preferences are not directly observable, the provision of direct subsidies is more likely to incur the risk of adverse selection attracting firms that would have invested in innovation even in the absence of public support or dismiss some of the non‐financed projects, thus leaving unchanged or decreasing the overall level of expenditures in R&D',\n",

According to neo-institutional theory, in highly uncertain environments, rivals are likely to imitate the market leader because they assume it possesses superior market knowledge. Combining these two lines of argument, we argue that a rival’s decision whether to follow or run away from the market leader depends on environmental uncertainty and market leadership, the latter expressing the extent to which the market leader owns a larger market share vis-à-vis the other rivals. The empirical analysis relies on data about the product line strategies of 66 mobile phone vendors in the 1994–2010 period. The results show that when environmental uncertainty is low, the relationship between a firm’s market leadership and imitation by its rivals is negative, whereas in conditions of high environmental uncertainty, imitation of the market leader increases with its market leadership',\n",

Our data rely on the global company database Orbis and allow the introduction of an original definition of FDI that accounts for the FDI direction – inward vs. outward – and the FDI margin – extensive vs. intensive. Based on the available information, we ask two questions. First, how deep is the FDI involvement of European enterprises? Second, is there any systematic relationship between FDI involvement and firm-level performance? To answer these questions, we adopt an empirical methodology consisting of descriptive statistics and econometric regressions (Probit, Bivariate Probit, and Poisson models). Concerning the depth of FDI involvement, our descriptive statistics reveal that the number of firms involved in inward/outward FDI is quite notable. However, firms’ actual involvement is rather low, meaning that FDI involvement in the EU is widespread, but not deep. Concerning the relationship between FDI involvement and firm-level performance, our econometric regressions show that better enterprises experience some inward/outward FDI rather than none. Moreover, the deeper the FDI involvement, the wider is the gap with domestic firms. This suggests that performance differentials are related to both the extensive and intensive margins of both inward and outward FDI.',\n",

They are typically ill-defined problems, that is, the goals are not definite; we don't know what counts as an alternative and how many alternatives there are; it's unclear what the consequences might be and how to estimate their probabilities and utilities. This environment might be called Large World (Savage 1954) and it is characterized by uncertainty. Small Worlds instead are in principle predictable and without surprises, and they are characterized by risk, that is, by the knowledge of all relevant variables, their consequences and probabilities. The conditions of the Small World are the requirements of Neoclassical Rationality. In any case, the real world is most of the time large, and these conditions of knowledge are rarely met. Hence, the normative rational requirements of neoclassical economics are unjustified and the application of their theories can easily lead to a disaster (Stiglitz 2010). Unfortunately, behavioural economics, despite its critiques of the descriptive side of neoclassical economics, still retains the normative one. On the contrary, in a Large World the axioms of rationality can't be applied. Therefore they can't be considered feasible normative canons of rationality. Is the label of irrational behaviour attributed to biases and errors discovered by behavioral economics justified? The answer is no, as in a Large World rationality must be judged in relation to the proper adaptation of the choices and problem solutions to a given environment. Rationality can't be formal but only Ecological. What kind of reasoning processes are able to match the environmental tasks and solve these problems? This is an empirical question that has been faced some years ago by some cognitive scientists, as Herbert Simon, Vernon Smith, Richard Selten, and in particular and more directly by Gerd Gigerenzer and the Abc group (Gigerenzer, Todd and Abc Group 1999). The adaptive toolbox of formalized simple heuristics is the result of these empirical investigation. In a number of problems, simple heuristics were more accurate than standard statistical methods that have the same amount of information or more. The results became known as the «less-is-more effect». There is a point where more is not better, but harmful. There is an inverse-U-shaped relation between level of accuracy and amount of information, computation, or time (Gigerenzer and Gassmaier 2011 p. 453).\",\n",

More specifically, we use unique data from the US, UK, and Italy to show that two major classes of social resource—personality and social capital—are significant predictors of planning capacity. We use the data to estimate frontier models that help establish three empirical facts about the ability to plan. First, planning ability depends on a rich array of social resources including networks, the freedom to participate, neighbourhood co‐operation, and trust (social capital) and personality traits such as extroversion, conscientiousness, and emotional stability. Secondly, we provide evidence that some personalities are more efficient than others in using resources to help them plan. Thirdly, we develop evidence of three personality profiles, referred to as ‘over‐controlled’, ‘resilient’ and ‘under‐controlled,’ and highlight the fact that these three profiles benefit differently from various aspects of social resources capital. We discuss these findings and conclude that a wide range of economic policies designed to facilitate individual planning may need to allow for heterogeneities in social resources if they are to be successful.',\n",

We provide a closed form characterization on the unique Nash equilibrium in the underlying static congestion game and we prove that the equilibrium crucially depends on the aggregate congestion. Not only do we provide a local stability condition in terms of the agents’ reactivity and the nonlinearity of the cost functions but also we study the role of the heterogeneity in this context.

Thanks to the combined action of the price mechanism and of the share updating rule, the model is able to reproduce the recurrent dynamic behavior typical of the fashion cycle, presenting booms and busts both in the agents’ consumption choices and in the population shares. More precisely, we investigate the existence of equilibria, their stability, and we perform a qualitative bifurcation analysis on varying the parameter describing the groups heterogeneity degree.

This paper seeks to remedy this deficiency by focusing on logrolling among interest groups in fragmented autocracies, and tries to pick apart the black-box of decision making in autocracies. In particular, we focus on China where decision making exemplifies a process of logrolling among key actors in the political system. The key question in this paper is: what are the effects of the logrolling of parochial interest groups on state policies and social welfare in autocracies?  We address this question both theoretically and empirically. The theoretical model helps us to focus on a specific distortion in resource allocation because of logrolling, while the econometric results confirm our theoretical prediction in a very robust way. To find out the distinctive consequences of autocratic logrolling on state policy and social welfare, we compare the policy outcomes under logrolling with the policy outcomes under different decision-making rules. We find policy outcomes under logrolling are characterized by excessive spending on all the interest groups’ preferred goods and insufficient spending on public goods. Finally, the paper provides empirical evidence on autocratic logrolling by studying the effects of the interaction between two vertical bureaucracies in China – the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Ministry of Health. In particular, we test the predictions of our model and identify the effects of logrolling in autocracies. Building on the existing literature, we introduce new approaches, including natural experiment and placebo test, to empirically test the existence of logrolling and identify its effects. We show that the direction of inefficiency on resource allocation is in accordance with the prediction in our theoretical model.',\n",

This paper is a first attempt towards the construction of such a general model. In this model, individual human capital, government responsiveness and economic development are seen as potential factors influencing individual choice to use terrorism as a political strategy. In this paper, we elaborate a strategic model of terrorism with a specific focus on domestic terrorism, in which the individual choice of joining a terrorist organization is a way of pursing specific political aims. This decision is in turn influenced by the interaction between terrorist’ activity, political engagement and government policies. We are able to prove that three different political regimes form the equilibrium outcomes, and that there is not a simple monotonic relationship between a regime accountability and terrorism’ repression.

This motivates us to consider an heterogeneous population where best responders and imitators coexist and compete in a deterministic oligopoly framework. The model we formulate is characterized by two stationary states, specifically the Cournot-Nash equilibrium and a further production level at which best responders are inactive and imitators produce at the marked clearing price. The heterogeneities among players gives to the model a nonlinear structure, influence the stability properties of the Cournot-Nash equilibrium and give rise to complex dynamical scenarios. We found that the imitators’ relative fraction have an ambiguous role in determining the stability properties of the Cournot-Nash equilibrium and, provided intermediate values of the population size, its variations may cause the occurrence of both a flip and a Neimark-Sacker bifurcations.

The polarization of these steady states, which coexist with an unbiased steady state, positively depends on that of the beliefs and on their relevance.

Our focus is on the inverse use of the SSD curve with the aim of estimating the concentration, HCp, of a toxic compound that is hazardous to p% of the biological community under study. Toward this end, we propose the use of robust statistical methods in order to take into account the presence of outliers or apparent skew in the data, which may occur without any ecological basis. A robust approach exploits the full neighborhood of a parametric model, enabling the analyst to account for the typical real-world deviations from ideal models. We examine two classic HCp estimation approaches and consider robust versions of these estimators. In addition, we also use data transformations in conjunction with robust estimation methods in case of heteroscedasticity. Different scenarios using real data sets as well as simulated data are presented in order to illustrate and compare the proposed approaches.

While day-ahead prices are likely to decline as RES-E production increases, the effects on balancing market sessions are more ambiguous. Taking into account the Northern Italian zone characterized by a high solar PV and hydro penetration, we provide empirical evidence that balancing quantities decreased while costs increased between two samples associated with low (2006–08) and high (2013–15) RES levels. We estimate balancing costs for different technologies and compare their dynamics across specific hours. We find evidence of increasing balancing prices in particular market conditions, that we interpret as a signal of strategic use of real time sessions by conventional producers prone to the merit order effect in the day-ahead market. We compare our results to those obtained in the German market (where, on the contrary, balancing costs have decreased) and postulate that the different market designs may explain these results. Our findings suggest that the Italian policy makers should carefully monitor all trading sessions, especially those close to real time, to avoid the exercise of market power by few operators allowed to guarantee system security and, additionally, to promptly adopt a capacity market.',\n",

Our structural econometric specification is consistent with an economic model of the market for Colombian coffee which, in the short run, is characterized by a downward-sloping demand curve and by a vertical supply curve. We show that El Niño (i.e., positive shocks to ENSO) is beneficial for Colombian production and exports and decreases the real price of Colombian coffee. On the contrary, La Niña (i.e., negative shocks to ENSO) depresses Colombian coffee production and exports and increases price. However, the overall impact of ENSO shocks is small. Both in the short run and in the long run, shocks to international demand for Colombian coffee are more relevant than supply-side shocks in Colombia in explaining the dynamics of the price of Colombian coffee.

Besides recent criticism on the validity of the random field assumption, a spatial specificity paradox remains: the larger the detected cluster, the less we know about the location of activation within that cluster. This is because cluster inference implies \"there exists at least one voxel with an evoked response in the cluster\", and not that \"all the voxels in the cluster have an evoked response\". Inference on voxels within selected clusters is considered bad practice, due to the voxel-wise false positive rate inflation associated with this circular inference. Here, we propose a remedy to the spatial specificity paradox. By applying recent results from the multiple testing statistical literature, we are able to quantify the proportion of truly active voxels within selected clusters, an approach we call All-Resolutions Inference (ARI). If this proportion is high, the paradox vanishes. If it is low, we can further \"drill down\" from the cluster level to sub-regions, and even to individual voxels, in order to pinpoint the origin of the activation. In fact, ARI allows inference on the proportion of activation in all voxel sets, no matter how large or small, however these have been selected, all from the same data. We use two fMRI datasets to demonstrate the non-triviality of the spatial specificity paradox, and its resolution using ARI. We verify that the endless circularity permitted by ARI does not render its estimates overly conservative using both simulation, and a data split',\n",

Given the altered and heterogenous nature of cancer metabolism, we here propose to use the overall expression of central carbon metabolism as biomarker to characterize groups of patients with important characteristics, such as response to ad-hoc therapeutic strategies and survival expectancy. To this end, we here introduce the data integration framework named Metabolic Reaction Enrichment Analysis (MaREA), which strives to characterize the metabolic deregulations that distinguish cancer phenotypes, by projecting RNA-seq data onto metabolic networks, without requiring metabolic measurements. MaREA computes a score for each network reaction, based on the expression of the set of genes encoding for the associated enzyme(s). The scores are first used as features for cluster analysis and then to rank and visualize in an organized fashion the metabolic deregulations that distinguish cancer sub-types. We applied our method to recent lung and breast cancer RNA-seq datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and we were able to identify subgroups of patients with significant differences in survival expectancy. We show how the prognostic power of MaREA improves when an extracted and further curated core model focusing on central carbon metabolism is used rather than the genome-wide reference network. The visualization of the metabolic differences between the groups with best and worst prognosis allowed to identify and analyze key metabolic properties related to cancer aggressiveness. Some of these properties are shared across different cancer (sub) types, e.g., the up-regulation of nucleic acid and amino acid synthesis, whereas some other appear to be tumor-specific, such as the up- or down-regulation of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase reaction, which display different patterns in distinct tumor (sub)types.

Inequality in energy intensity is measured by using the Zenga inequality index. The analysis is carried out by measuring inequality from the bottom of the energy intensity distribution to the top. This approach enables to identify the most unequal portions of the energy intensity distribution. To provide information on the causes of inequality at every point of the distribution, we show that inequality can be broken down into three components explaining the roles played by energy transformation, final energy intensity and their interaction in determining inequality in energy intensity. This decomposition reveals the impact of each component of inequality from the bottom of energy intensity distribution to the top. Results show that final energy intensity plays a major role in explaining inequality in the energy intensity distribution. The interaction component explains that EU-28 countries with low energy intensity are more efficient in energy transformation and less energy-intensive in enduse sectors than EU-28 countries with high energy intensity. The energy transformation component is higher when measuring inequality between the countries at the bottom of the distribution and those in the rest of the distribution, suggesting that disparities in energy transformation efficiency play an important role in determining inequality in energy intensity between the least energy-intensive countries and the other countries. The high inequality at the top of the distribution is due to the lower efficiency in energy transformation in the most energy-intensive countries, which reinforces the effect of disparity in final energy intensity between the countries at the top of the distribution and the other countries.',\n",

For each population we collected environmental data on landscape (habitat size, quality and fragmentation) and local conditions (slope, presence of alien species, incidence of the herbivorous insect Metcalfa pruinosa and soil parameters). We measured vegetative and reproductive traits in the field and analysed the genetic population structure using ISSR markers (STRUCTURE and AMOVA). We then estimated the neutral (F-ST) and quantitative (P-ST) genetic differentiation of populations.   Results. The populations exhibited moderate phenotypic variation. Population size (range: 16-655 individuals), number of flowering adults (range: 3-420 individuals) and inflorescence size (range: 5.0-8.4 cm) were positively related to Mg soil content. Populations' gene diversity was moderate (Nei-H = 0.071-0.1316); STRUCTURE analysis identified five different clusters and three main geographic groups: upper, lower, and Apennine/Western Po plain. Fragmentation did not have an influence on the local adaptation of populations, which for all measured traits showed P-ST < F-ST) indicating convergent selection.   Discussion. The variation of phenotypic traits across sites was attributed to plastic response rather than local adaptation. Plant translocation from suitable source populations to endangered ones should particularly take into account provenance according to identified genetic clusters and specific soil factors\",\n",

The occurrence of these events is influenced by land-uses in the surroundings of airports. Airports located in the same region might have different trends for birdstrike risk, due to differences in the surrounding habitats. Here we developed a quantitative tool that assesses the risk of birdstrike based on the habitats within a 13-km buffer from the airport. For this purpose, we developed Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) with binomial distribution to estimate the contribution of habitats to wildlife use of the study area, depending on season. These GLMs predictions were combined to the flight altitude of birds within the 13-km buffer, the airport traffic pattern and the severity indices associated with impacts. Our approach was developed at Venice Marco Polo International airport (VCE), located in northeast Italy and then tested at Treviso Antonio Canova International airport (TSF), which is 20 km inland. Results from the two airports revealed that both the surrounding habitats and the season had a significant influence to the pattern of risk. With regard to VCE, agricultural fields, wetlands and urban areas contributed most to the presence of birds in the study area. Furthermore, the key role of distance of land-uses from the airport on the probability of presence of birds was highlighted. The reliability of developed risk index was demonstrated since at VCE it was significantly correlated with bird strike rate. This study emphasizes the importance of the territory near airports and the wildlife use of its habitats, as factors in need of consideration for birdstrike risk assessment procedures. Information on the contribution of habitats in attracting birds, depending on season, can be used by airport managers and local authorities to plan specific interventions in the study area in order to lower the risk.',\n",

Pre-industrial fire-history records from black carbon, charcoal and other proxies provide baseline estimates of biomass burning at local to global scales spanning millennia, and are thus useful to examine the role of fire in the carbon cycle and climate system. Here we use the specific biomarker levoglucosan together with black carbon and ammonium concentrations from the North Greenland Eemian (NEEM) ice cores (77.49 degrees N, 51.2 degrees W; 2480 ma.s.l) over the past 2000 years to infer changes in boreal fire activity. Increases in boreal fire activity over the periods 1000-1300 CE and decreases during 700-900 CE coincide with high-latitude NH temperature changes. Levoglucosan concentrations in the NEEM ice cores peak between 1500 and 1700 CE, and most levoglucosan spikes coincide with the most extensive central and northern Asian droughts of the past millennium. Many of these multi-annual droughts are caused by Asian monsoon failures, thus suggesting a connection between low-and high-latitude climate processes. North America is a primary source of biomass burning aerosols due to its relative proximity to the Greenland Ice Cap. During major fire events, however, isotopic analyses of dust, back trajectories and links with levoglucosan peaks and regional drought reconstructions suggest that Siberia is also an important source of pyrogenic aerosols to Greenland',\n",

In such cases, the split-plot design structure, in which the experimental runs are performed in groups, is a commonly used cost-efficient approach that reduces the number of independent settings of the hard-to-change factors. Several criteria can be adopted for optimizing split-plot experimental designs: the most frequently used are D-optimality and I-optimality. A multi-objective approach to the optimal design of split-plot experiments, the coordinate-exchange two-phase local search (CE-TPLS), is proposed. The CE-TPLS algorithm is able to approximate the set of experimental designs which concurrently minimize the D-criterion and the I-criterion. It allows for a flexible choice of the number of hard-to-change factors, the number of easy-to-change factors, the number of whole plots and the total sample size. When tested on four case studies from the literature, the proposed algorithm returns meaningful sets of experimental designs, covering the whole spectrum between the two objectives. On most of the analyzed cases, the CE-TPLS algorithm returns better results than those reported in the original papers and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm in terms of computational time, while retaining a comparable performance in terms of the quality of the optima for each single objective.',\n",

Methods: Self-administered questionnaires (with items exploring driving habits) were distributed to 339 students who had a driver's license and attended 1 of 7 high schools in Bologna, Italy. Statistical analysis were performed to describe lifestyle habits, sleep quality, sleepiness, and their relationship with the binary dependent variable (presence or absence of car crashes) to identify the factors significantly affecting the probability of car crashes in a multivariate binary logistic regression model. Results: Nineteen percent of the sample reported bad sleep, 64% complained of daytime sleepiness, and 40% reported sleepiness while driving. Eighty students (24%), 76% of which were males, reported that they had already crashed at least once, and 15% considered sleepiness to have been the main cause of their crash. As compared with adolescents who had not had a crash, those who had at least 1 previous crash reported that they more frequently used to drive (79% vs 62%), drove at night (25% vs 9%), drove while sleepy (56% vs 35%), had bad sleep (29% vs 16%), and used stimulants such as caffeinated soft drinks (32% vs 19%), tobacco (54% vs 27%), and drugs (21% vs 7%).

We shed light on the role of economic conditions in shaping the effect of retirement on mental health by exploiting time and regional variation in the severity of the economic crisis across 10 European countries during 2004–2013. We use data from four waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe and address the potential endogeneity of the retirement decision to mental health by applying a fixed-effects instrumental variables approach. The results indicate that retirement improves the mental health of men but not that of women. This effect is stronger for blue-collar men working in regions that have been severely hit by the economic crisis. These findings may be explained by the worsening of working conditions and the rise in job insecurity stemming from the economic downturn: under these circumstances, exit from the labour force is perceived as a relief.

Yet we also know that individuals' skill levels change during childhood and into adulthood, not least as a result of their education, training and work experience. Thus parents' adult skill levels are potentially as important in predicting the cognitive and non-cognitive skills of their children. The aims of this paper are two fold. Firstly, to assess the strength of the intergenerational correlation between parental skill in adulthood, specifically literacy and numeracy skills, and their children's early skills. The second aim is to assess whether, from a policy perspective, identifying adults with poor basic skills in literacy and numeracy is helpful in devising policies to target children at risk of having poor cognitive and non-cognitive skills. The data used are from the British Cohort Study (BCS), which in 2004 assessed cohort members' adult literacy and numeracy skills and, for a subset of the cohort, the cognitive and non-cognitive skills of their children. We find strong evidence that parents with better numeracy and literacy in adulthood have children who perform better in early cognitive and non-cognitive tests. This finding is not simply due to the positive correlation between parents' early cognitive skills and their adult cognitive skills. Rather, parents' adult skill levels provide additional useful information to help explain their children's early skills in regressions that also control for parents' own early cognitive skills as measured at age five. This paper provides clear support for the notion that identifying parents with poor literacy and numeracy skills can help us predict which children are most at risk of having poor skills themselves.\",\n",

In a dynamic panel data setting, using a unique database comprising data from 17,462 firms, we estimate an augmented cost share equation whereby the wage bill share of skilled workers in a given firm is related to international exposure and technology adoption. It emerges that R&D expenditures are positive and significantly related to skill upgrading. This result supports the skill-biased technological change argument in the case of a middle-income country such as Turkey. Moreover, the firm-level analysis reveals a positive impact of technological transfer from abroad, foreign ownership and exporting status on the demand for skills, highlighting the role of increasing international openness in fostering skill upgrading within firms. Our microdata also allow us to investigate the direct impact of import flows in shaping the relative demand for skills. The results show that those firms belonging to the sectors experiencing rapid increase in the share of inputs imported from industrialised countries also experience a higher increase in the labour cost share of skilled workers. This finding provides further support for the hypothesis that imports from industrialised countries imply a transfer of new technologies, in turn leading to a higher demand for skilled labour (the so-called skill-enhancing trade hypothesis).',\n",

Although an inappropriate modelling of systematic components could have important consequences on the prediction of loads and prices, in the literature it has not yet been assessed, which approach is more appropriate for electricity markets time series. This work aims at filling this gap by comparing the deterministic and the stochastic approach in a systematic way and in a homogeneous framework, both for loads and prices. In the deterministic case, components are represented by smoothing splines and dummy variables, while in the stochastic case they are described by stochastic processes common to the unobserved component modelling literature. As systematic components are not observable, the comparison is based on the prediction implications of the two procedures. This allows us to account for possible compensations among estimated components on the final result. Predictive performance is mainly assessed with respect to the one-day-ahead horizon, but also seven-day-ahead predictions are considered.

Methods An interactive and emergent research design was used consisting of a literature review, qualitative expert questionnaires and case reports. We defined integrated care as interventions targeting at least two of the six Chronic Care Model components. Workforce changes were defined as those changes experienced by clinical and non-clinical staff responsible for public and individual health intervention. Results Seven workforce changes were identified: (1) nurse involvement, (2) multidisciplinary staff, (3) multidisciplinary protocols/pathways, (4) provider training, (5) case manager/care coordinator, (6) team meetings, and (7) new positions. Most interventions included more than one of these workforce changes. Conclusion The results of this study provide detailed insights into the current implementation of workforce changes in integrated care interventions and thereby pave the way for further investigations into the relative effectiveness of different workforce changes within the scope of complex interventions. Advancing knowledge in this area is essential for fostering health systems’ capacity to cope with the challenges related to the current demographic and epidemiological trends',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Background: In several health systems of advanced countries, reforms have changed primary care in the last two decades. The literature has assessed the effects of a variety of interventions and individual factors on the behavior of general practitioners (GPs). However, there has been a lack of investigation concerning the influence of the resources embedded in the GPs' personal advice networks (i.e., social capital) on GPs' capacity to meet defined objectives. The present study has two goals: (a) to assess the GPs' personal advice networks according to the social capital framework and (b) to test the influence of such relationships on GPs' capacity to accomplish organizational goals. Methods: The data collection relied on administrative data provided by an Italian local health authority (LHA) and a survey administered to the GPs of the selected LHA. The GPs' personal advice networks were assessed through an ad-hoc instrument and interpreted as egocentric networks. Multivariate regression analyses assessed two different performance measures. Results: Social capital may influence the GPs' capacity to meet targets, though the influence differs according to the objective considered. In particular, the higher the professional heterogeneity of a GP personal advice network, the lower her/his capacity is to meet targets of prescriptive appropriateness. Conclusions: Our findings might help to design more effective primary care reforms depending on the pursued goals. However, further research is needed\",\n",

Given the involvement of health professionals in all aspects of integrated care delivery, changes to the health workforce are seen as a key enabler of integrated health services delivery. Objectives: The first aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes of integrated care interventions for people with chronic conditions that included workforce changes. The second aim was to develop preliminary insights into the relative benefits of measuring the outcomes of workforce changes that are part of integrated care interventions as opposed to measuring integrated care interventions that included workforce changes.  Method: Data were collected by means of an expert questionnaire and a literature review. While the expert questionnaire investigated the outcomes of the workforce changes that were part of an integrated care intervention, the literature review investigated the outcomes of integrated care interventions that included workforce changes. Results: Overall, both approaches found positive outcomes, in particular for quality of care (including clinical patient outcomes and process measures), patient satisfaction and staff satisfaction. Outcomes were reported for the same categories in the studies as in the questionnaires.  Conclusion: We recommend that health managers and policy makers invest in workforce changes and to (re-)consider strategies that may be detrimental to the health workforce and which could thereby adversely affect patient health and patient experiences of care',\n",

Background: For the burgeoning cohort of older patients considered for kidney transplantation, evidence gaps regarding frailty and mild cognitive impairment limit clinical decision-making and medical management. As known risk factors for ‘hard’ clinical outcomes in chronic illness, both require further study in transplantation. Integrating these and other bio-psychosocial factors into a comprehensive pre-transplant patient assessment will provide insights regarding economic implications and may improve risk prediction. Design: A nation-wide multi-centre prospective cohort study nested in the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study. Methods: Our nationally representative convenience sample includes 250 adult kidney transplant recipients. Data sources include the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study and primary data collected at time of transplantation, 6 months, 1 and 2 years post-transplant via established measures (the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Psychosocial Questionnaire, Fried Frailty Instrument and a blood analysis), investigator-developed instruments and datasets compiled by hospitals’ management control units, sickness funds, the Swiss Federal Statistical Office and the European Renal Association. Descriptive, competing risk survival and mixed effects analyses will be performed. Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained in January 2016.

Continuous regional anesthesia for outpatients has been shown effective but the economic impact on the perioperative process-related healthcare costs remains unclear. Methods: One hundred twenty consecutive patients were included in this assessor-blinded, prospective cohort study and allocated according to inclusion criteria in the day-care or in the in-patient group. Standardized continuous popliteal sciatic nerve block was performed in both groups for 48\\xa0h using an elastomeric pump delivering ropivacaine 0.2\\xa0% at a rate of 5\\xa0ml/h with an additional 5\\xa0ml bolus every 60\\xa0min. Outpatients were discharged the day of surgery and followed with standardized telephone interviews. The total direct health costs of both groups were compared. Moreover, the difference in treatment costs and the difference in terms of quality of care and effectiveness between the groups were compared. Results: Total management costs were significantly reduced in the day-care group. There was no difference between the groups regarding pain at rest and with motion, persistent pain after catheter removal and the incidence of PONV. Persistent motor block and catheter inflammation/infection were comparable in both groups. There was neither a difference in the number of unscheduled ambulatory visits nor in the number of readmissions. Conclusions: Day-care continuous regional analgesia leads to an overall positive impact on costs by decreasing the incidence of unplanned ambulatory visits and unscheduled readmissions, without compromising on the quality of analgesia, patients’ satisfaction, and safety',\n",

However, demographic and epidemiologic trends, together with technologic advances are associated with emerging clusters of complex patients. Rural and/or remote areas tend to anticipate the national demographic forecasts. Therefore, concerns about appropriate health services accessibility are legitimate. Method: We selected three cases of health service delivery in rural and/or remote areas resulting from reorganization of previously existing hospitals: two cases are located in Switzerland and one in Italy. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in each organization, where researchers collected also official documents. Each researcher coded the data independently. Then codes were iteratively discussed to identify common dimensions suitable for comparison across the cases. Discussion: The comparative analysis showed that the apparent contrast between social/health and policy/managerial instances has reached a point of equilibrium. The reorganization processes can be interpreted as an optimization of the coordination of the health and social resources available within and close to the community.

We administered an ad-hoc questionnaire to all Italian local health units (LHUs), with a 60.4% response rate, and used structural equation modeling to assess the relationships between the relevant latent constructs. The results validated our measure of care integration and supported the hypothesized relationships.

Primary caregivers of stroke patients were interviewed at 3, 6 and 12 months after the acute event and use of healthcare and informal care were documented. The panel dataset included socio-demographic, clinical and economic data on patients and caregivers. A longitudinal log-linear model was applied to test the impact of informal care on total healthcare costs in the observation period. A double hurdle model was used to investigate the impact of informal care on rehabilitation costs. A total of 476 of stroke survivors in 44 hospitals were enrolled in the study and presence of informal caregiver was reported in approximately 50% of the sample (range 48.2-52.5% across the three periods). Healthcare costs at 12 months after the acute event are €5825 per patient, with rehabilitation costs amounting to €3985 (68.4%). Healthcare costs are significantly different between the patients with and without caregiver in all three periods. The presence of the caregiver is associated with 54.7% increase in direct healthcare costs (p < 0.01). Instead, the amount of informal care provided does not influence significantly direct healthcare costs. The presence of caregiver significantly increases the probability of access to rehabilitation services (β = 0.648, p = 0.039) while, once the decision on access is made, it doesn't influence the amount of services used.

Radon is the principal contributor to natural background radiation and is considered to be one of the major leading causes of lung cancer. The main concern revolves around indoor environments where radon accumulates and reaches high concentrations. In this paper, a semiparametric random-effect M-quantile model is introduced to model radon concentration inside a building, and a way to estimate the model within the framework of robust maximum likelihood is presented. Using data collected in a monitoring survey carried out in the Lombardy Region (Italy) in 2003–2004, we investigate the impact of a number of factors, such as geological typologies of the soil and building characteristics, on indoor concentration. The proposed methodology permits the identification of building typologies prone to a high concentration of the pollutant. It is shown how these effects are largely not constant across the entire distribution of indoor radon concentration, making the suggested approach preferable to ordinary regression techniques since high concentrations are usually of concern. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our model provides a natural way of identifying those areas more prone to high concentration, displaying them by thematic maps. Understanding how buildings’ characteristics affect indoor concentration is fundamental both for preventing the gas from accumulating in new buildings and for mitigating those situations where the amount of radon detected inside a building is too high and has to be reduced.',\n",

Empirical evidence of the evolving fuels-electricity nexus is shown looking at one Italian zone across two samples characterized by a significant change in the level of RES penetration. We conduct the analysis taking into account both day-ahead and, for the first time, balancing market sessions. Results indicate that fuel prices are much less relevant in determining the dynamics of electricity prices in recent years characterized by high RES penetration. On the contrary, taking into account flexible thermal sources, we show that in the second sample balancing and fuel prices (especially gas) are in a long run equilibrium.',\n",
